# Capstone Reproducible Analysis Repo

This repo contains a small, reproducible analysis workflow for my CYBR 698 capstone. It includes a simple one-step script, a sample dataset, run logs, and a containerized environment so the analysis can be repeated consistently.

## How to Run (Local)

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From the project root, run:

   ```bash
   python3 src/analyze_dataset.py
